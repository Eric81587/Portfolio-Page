  <h1>Eric D. Roragen-Eggers</h1>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Born in Martinez, California, located in the Bay Area. I lived most of my life there and went to K-12 and Heald
    colloge for my associates degree. I met the love of my life in 3rd grade but we were best friends through school and
    life until we were almost in our thirties. We were living together in Martinez for about a year before a family
    emergency led us to rent a home in a nerby town to live with our parents. Afterwards we were able to move to Oregon
    in December of 2016. Not to long after that, during an eclipse in 2018 I asked her to MArry me and we have been
    together and happy ever since. We were blessed enough to have a new little girl added to our family named Aria.</p>
