    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Born in Martinez, California, located in the Bay Area. I lived most of my life there and went to K-12 and Heald
      colloge for my associates degree. I met the love of my life in 3rd grade and we were best friends through school
      and life until we were almost in our thirties. We were living together in Martinez for about a year before a house
      fire displaced us for a few months. Afterwards we were able to move to Oregon in December of 2016. Not to long
      after that, during an eclipse in 2018 I asked her to Marry me and we have been together and happy ever since. We
      were blessed enough to have a new baby girl added to our family named Aria.</p>

  <h3>Why Programming?</h3>
  <p>I have been in the accounting field for over 15 years. I have always been very good at Math and problem solving
    which translated very well into the field. It has always had a very solid employment rate and is a safe bet for a
    career but it is not something I was passionate about. After searching for something that would make me want to come
    to work everyday I stumbled upon coding and have not been able to put it down ever since. I have no doubt that my
    skills will transfer over without any issue and the amount of information that is readily available and the fact
    that you will continuesly learn new ideas and methodology is very exciting.<span>I CANNOT WAIT TO PUT EVERY ONCE OF
      MY WORK ETHIC INTO BECOMING A BETTER PROGRAMMER EVERY DAY!</span></p>
